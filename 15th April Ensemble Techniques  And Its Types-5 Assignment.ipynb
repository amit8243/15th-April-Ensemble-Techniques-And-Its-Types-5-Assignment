    "Here is a brief explanation of each step in the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: This step identifies the most important features in the dataset. This is done using a\n",
    "statistical method called the F-test. The F-test measures the importance of a feature by comparing the \n",
    "variance of the feature values between the two classes.\n",
    "Numerical pipeline: This pipeline imputes the missing values in the numerical columns using the mean of \n",
    "the column values. It then scales the numerical columns using standardization. Standardization is a \n",
    "normalization technique that scales the values of each column to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation\n",
    "of 1. This makes the values of the columns comparable to each other.\n",
    "Categorical pipeline: This pipeline imputes the missing values in the categorical columns using the most \n",
    "frequent value of the column. It then one-hot encodes the categorical columns. One-hot encoding is a \n",
    "technique that converts categorical features into numerical features. This is done by creating a new \n",
    "column for each possible value of the categorical feature. The value of the new column is 1 if the feature\n",
    "has that value, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "ColumnTransformer: This object combines the numerical and categorical pipelines into a single pipeline. \n",
    "This allows us to process the numerical and categorical features together.\n",
    "Random Forest Classifier: This is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. \n",
    "It works by constructing a forest of decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a subset of the\n",
    "training data. The predictions of the decision trees are then combined to make a final prediction.\n",
    "Accuracy: This is a measure of how well the model predicts the labels of the test data. It is calculated\n",
    "by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "The results of the pipeline show that the model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test data. This \n",
    "suggests that the model is able to generalize well to new data. The model is able to achieve this high \n",
    "accuracy because it has been trained on a dataset that has been pre-processed using the pipeline. The \n",
    "pipeline has identified the important features in the dataset, imputed the missing values, and scaled the\n",
    "features. These steps have helped the model to learn the relationships between the features and the target\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible improvements to the pipeline could include using a different feature selection method, or using a\n",
    "different machine learning algorithm. Other improvements could include using a different normalization\n",
    "technique, or using a different way to handle the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Build a pipeline that includes a random forest classifier and a logistic regression classifier, and then\n",

    "# Print the accuracy\n",
    "print('Accuracy:', accuracy)\n",

    "Accuracy: 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the voting classifier was able to correctly classify all of the data points in the test \n",
    "set. This is a very good result, and it suggests that the voting classifier is able to learn from both the\n",
    "random forest classifier and the logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voting classifier works by combining the predictions of multiple models. In this case, the voting \n",
    "classifier is combining the predictions of the random forest classifier and the logistic regression \n",
    "classifier. The predictions of the models are combined using a soft voting scheme. In a soft voting \n",
    "scheme, each model's prediction is weighted by its accuracy. The model with the highest accuracy has the \n",
    "highest weight. The predictions of the models are then averaged, and the final prediction is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The voting classifier is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning\n",
    "models. It is especially useful when the models are trained on different data sets or when the models use \n",
    "different algorithms.\n",
